# Blocktrail-Laravel5.4
API Wallet Blocktrail - Laravel Framework

This work was originally produced by: https://github.com/blocktrail/simple-block-explorer

Due to the great demand for a more up-to-date version of the project, I made an adjustment to make it run perfectly, in the latest version of the Laravel Framework.

Still contains a lot of things that were not properly fixed for varsion 5.4 due to my lack of in-depth knowledge of the framework.

Anyone who may be contributing to the better development of the Project will be willing to listen to all the suggestions.

The project is already in full version and the Database File is in project / database / DBBlocktrail.sql

API-Key should be included In both .env and BlocktrailSKD files


As this is an independent development, anyone who is willing to send a contribution for the effort and dedicated time follows my wallet:
